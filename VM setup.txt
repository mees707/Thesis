steps on how to replicate the VM used in the experiments (on windows):

setting up the software that will run the VM (might be possible on other VM software but not tested)

1) download QEMU for windows:
   https://qemu.weilnetz.de/
   go to w64 -> qemu-w64-setup-<version>.exe   
   follow installer instructions
2) setting up PATH:
   go to system properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
   click on path -> select edit -> New 
   insert the location where qemu is downloaded (most likely C:\Program Files\qemu)
   check if done properly by running qemu-system-x86_64.exe in CMD or powershell
3) download the VM (need to set up a download link)
   

launcing the VM and setting up SSH:
1) open a terminal in the location of the VM
   run:
     qemu-system-x86_64.exe -boot d -hda vm-mpquic-sbd-new.vmdk -m 8192 -smp 8 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:5555,hostfwd=tcp::5556-:5556 -net nic
   this will open qemu with port 2222
2) generating the key (host):
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 (or use another encryption method, RSA did not work for me)
   moving the key from host to vm (the vm should be running, executed on host):
     scp -P 2222 location/of/key/id_ed25519.pub mininet@localhost:/tmp (replace location with actual location, or move the key to folder the terminal is opened in)
   ssh into vm(host):
     ssh -p 2222 mininet@localhost
   move file inside of vm to correct place(vm)
     cat /tmp/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   this might give an error such as file not found, in that case:
     mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   and try again   
3) after this is done, log off and try (host)
     ssh -p 2222 mininet@localhost
   there should not be a password promt anymore.


THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, ALTHOUGH MOST STEPS ARE HERE NOW



NOT YET CLEAR ABOUT THESE STEPS:
# Create if it does not exists yet
The second one is to mount the file measurement location on the RAM. This should limit the impact of the hard disk on the results.
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/tmpfs
# This should be run each time the VM is restarted
$ sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=256M tmpfs /mnt/tmpfs
steps dont work so far
