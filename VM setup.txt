steps on how to replicate the VM used in the experiments (on windows):

setting up the software that will run the VM (might be possible on other VM software but not tested)

1) download QEMU for windows:
   https://qemu.weilnetz.de/
   go to w64 -> qemu-w64-setup-<version>.exe   
   follow installer instructions
2) setting up PATH:
   go to system properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
   click on path -> select edit -> New 
   insert the location where qemu is downloaded (most likely C:\Program Files\qemu)
   check if done properly by running qemu-system-x86_64.exe in CMD or powershell
3) download the VM (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QZWPEKMdnI3w2gtYhXZO6qcOCGgdpwWj/view?usp=drive_link)
   

launcing the VM and setting up SSH:
1) open a terminal in the location of the VM
   run:
     qemu-system-x86_64.exe -boot d -hda vm-mpquic-sbd-new.vmdk -m 8192 -smp 8 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:5555,hostfwd=tcp::5556-:5556 -net nic
   this will open qemu with port 2222
2) generating the key (host):
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 (or use another encryption method, RSA did not work for me)
   moving the key from host to vm (the vm should be running, executed on host):
     scp -P 2222 location/of/key/id_ed25519.pub mininet@localhost:/tmp (replace location with actual location, or move the key to folder the terminal is opened in)
   ssh into vm(host):
     ssh -p 2222 mininet@localhost
   move file inside of vm to correct place(vm)
     cat /tmp/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   this might give an error such as file not found, in that case:
     mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   and try again   
3) after this is done, log off and try (host)
     ssh -p 2222 mininet@localhost
   there should not be a password promt anymore.

after following these steps, the VM
